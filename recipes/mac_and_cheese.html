        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The addition of ham turns this quick stove-top macaroni and cheese recipe into a meal. With plenty of melted cheddar
        cheese, it's ready in less than 30 minutes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound cheddar cheese, grated (about 2 cups, packed)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 quarts water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk, heated until steamy, but not simmering</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ham, chopped into 1/4 inch cubes</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium-sized bowl, mix the cornstarch with the grated cheese
                <ul>
                    <li>So that the cheese is coated, set aside. The cornstarch will help the cheese from getting too stringy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cook the macaroni pasta in boiling water
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat 2 quarts of water with a tablespoon of salt to a rolling boil in thick-bottomed saucepan. Add 2 cups of elbow
                    macaroni and follow the cooking time instructions on the package, minus about 2 minutes. (If your macaroni doesn't come
                    with instructions, start checking at 7 minutes).
                    
                    Cook until al denteâ€”cooked through, but still slightly firm. Drain the pasta.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>While the macaroni is cooking, prepare the sauce
                <ul>
                    <li>Melt 2 Tbsp butter in a large saucepan on medium heat. Whisk in 2 Tbsp flour. Let cook for about a minute.
                    
                    Slowly dribble in 1 1/4 cups milk, while whisking (to avoid clumping) until the sauce is smooth.
                    
                    Slowly add the grated cheese, whisking until smooth. Stir in the lemon juice.
                    
                    If the macaroni isn't ready yet, lower the heat to a level just high enough to keep the sauce warm.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add the cooked macaroni and ham to the cheese sauce
                <ul>Stir to combine. Do not over-mix. Sprinkle with some freshly grated black pepper.
                
                Serve immediately.
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
