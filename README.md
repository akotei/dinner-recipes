# dinner-recipes

This project demonstrates my HTML skills in creating a user-friendly website
for dinner recipes. It includes anchor links for easy navigation, headers
for organization, images for visual appeal, and lists for clear presentation
of ingredients and steps.  The website covers appetizers, main dishes, and desserts, showcasing my ability to
create effective and engaging web content in the food industry.
